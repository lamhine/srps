# README: Survival Disparities Model (Black vs White)

This script runs a Bayesian logistic regression to estimate **Blackâ€“White disparities in 2-year survival** across different levels of a **city-level policy index**.

## What the code does

1. **Simulates example data** so you can see the structure and expected variables.  
   (We'll eventually replace this with the real CCR dataset.)

2. **Imputes missing data** using `mice`.

3. **Fits a Bayesian model** using `brms` with:
   - Outcome: `survived_2y` (1 = yes, 0 = no)
   - Key predictors: `race`, `policy_index`, and their interaction
   - Covariates: `age`, `sex`, `insured`, `married`
   - Random intercept for `city_id`

4. **Predicts survival probability** across a range of policy index values, separately for Black and White adults.

5. **Calculates the disparity** (Black minus White) in predicted survival for each policy level.

6. **Saves results** as:
   - `model_black_white_survival.rds` = fitted model
   - `disparity_black_white_over_policy.rds` = summarized results
   - `plot_black_white_disparity.png` = figure
   - `table2_posterior_effects.csv` = model coefficients

## To do to replace the simulated data:

In the script, find this line:

```r
sim_data <- real_data_frame
```

Uncomment and replace it with the actual data. The dataset should have the following variables or something similar:

| Variable       | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `survived_2y`  | Binary outcome: survived = 1, else 0 |
| `race`         | Should include at least Black + White |
| `policy_index` | Numeric score for each city          |
| `age`          | Age in years                         |
| `sex`          | "Male" or "Female"                   |
| `insured`      | "Yes" or "No"                        |
| `married`      | "Yes" or "No"                        |
| `city_id`      | City identifier                      |

### Notes

- `policy_index` should be **city-level**, but included in your person-level dataset (i.e., merged in already). I will provide this once it's done. 
- Make sure all categorical variables are coded as **factors**.

Let me know if you want to change the model, add more races, or customize the figure. Otherwise, once your data is loaded correctly, just run the script from top to bottom.
